<h3><u>So what is HTML?</u></h3>
<p>
HTML is a <b>markup language </b>that defines the structure of your content. It consists of a<br>
 series of elements which you use to enclose, or wrap different parts of the content to make it<br>
  appear or act a certain way. For example, if we wanted to a line to stand by itself, we could<br>
   specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
<h4>Anatomy of an HTML element  </h4>
<img src="image.png" height="150px" width="400px" alt="image">
<br>
The main parts of an HTML element are as follows:<br>
<ol>
          <li>
        The openning tag: This consists of the name of the element (e.g. p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect.
          </li>
           <li> The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends â€” in this case where the paragraph ends.
           </li>
           <li>other</li>
        </ol>
